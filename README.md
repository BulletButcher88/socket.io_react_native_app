# SOCKET.IO React Native App Example

A demo for implementing a mobile chatroom as well as practice for myself using React Native and Socket.io.

### Getting Started

Clone repository from here and run 
`npm i`
ensure this is done for  both `chatAppSocket` and `socket.io-backend` folders.

Development environment config will need to match your IP address not to `http://localhost`. Try `ifconfig` to search for it in the terminal.
