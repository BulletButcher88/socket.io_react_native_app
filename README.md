# SOCKET.IO React Native App Example

A demo for implementing a mobile chatroom as well as practice for myself using React Native and Socket.io.

## Getting Started

Clone repository from here and run
### `npm i`

Client /chatAppSocket
### `npm start`

Sever /socket.io-backend
### `nodemon server.js`

## Note
Development environment config will need to match your IP address not to `http://localhost`. Try `ifconfig` to search for it in the terminal.
